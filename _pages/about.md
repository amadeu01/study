Hey there! 👋 I’m Amadeu Cavalcante — part software engineer 👨‍💻, part bodybuilder 🏋️‍♂️, full-time cat dad 😸😸.

Born and raised in 🇧🇷 Brazil (powered by coffee and sunshine ☀️☕️), I took a detour through 🇸🇪 Sweden to sharpen my skills in iOS development, where I now craft sleek mobile apps with Swift and SwiftUI. If there’s a way to make code cleaner, faster, or more beautiful — I’m already doing it (or obsessing over it) 🚀.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me chasing PRs at the gym 🥇, reading ancient philosophy 📜 (big fan of Marcus Aurelius 💬), or negotiating peace treaties between my two mischievous (but adorable) cats, Beerus and Champa 🐱🐱.

Some say I once walked over 260km just for fun… and they’re absolutely right 🥾🌄.

My life motto?
Build things. Lift heavy. Stay curious. Pet cats. Repeat. 🔁

If you’re into tech, training, philosophy, or just really cute cats, we’ll probably get along just fine. 😎
